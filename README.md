**PyTVPaint** is a type-safe Python library that wraps the George programming language commands in order to interact with the 2D animation software TVPaint.

It communicates through WebSocket to a [custom C++ plugin](https://github.com/brunchstudio/tvpaint-rpc) running in an opened TVPaint instance.

You can check the [documentation](https://brunchstudio.github.io/pytvpaint/) for more details.

## Installation

### Requirements

- Windows (for now, see [this](https://brunchstudio.github.io/pytvpaint/limitations/#windows-only))
- Python v3.9+
- TVPaint v11.5+
- TVPaint RPC plugin (install instructions [here](https://brunchstudio.github.io/pytvpaint/installation/#tvpaint-plugin-installation))

Install the package with Pip:

```console
‚ùØ pip install pytvpaint
```

## Simple example

```python
from pytvpaint import george
from pytvpaint.project import Project

# Get access to tvp elements
project = Project.load("scene.tvpp", silent=True)

clip = project.current_clip
# Or get the clip by name
clip = project.get_clip(by_name="my_clip")

layer = clip.add_layer("my_new_layer")

# Check out other layers
for layer in clip.layers:
    print(layer.name)

# Get access to George functions
george.tv_rect(50, 50, 100, 100)

# Render your file
clip.render("./out.#.png", start=20, end=45)

project.close()
```
