The official Pytvpaint logo was made by Juliette Danesi ( [:simple-linkedin:](https://www.linkedin.com/in/juliette-danesi-1427561b6/) [:link:](https://juliettedanesi.wixsite.com/monsite/layout-posing) ) at BRUNCH Studio. :sparkles:

A special thanks also to our wonderful artists at the studio who also submitted some very interesting logos for the project. 
These were made as a joke, and do not represent the true skills of these talented individuals :sweat_smile:
